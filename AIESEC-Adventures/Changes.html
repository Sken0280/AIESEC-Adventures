  <body data-gr-c-s-loaded="true">The main issue that caused a drastic change in
    the initial design of the website is a result of a couple reasons. The first
    reason is that out of the 20 people i reached out to asking if they wanted
    to share their story, only 1 person was actually comfortable sharing which
    was really really un-forseen. Katherine was the only person that gave a
    detailed overview of her exchange. The others that went to taiwan this past
    summer didn't give detailed testimonials and lacked sufficient pictures. The
    second reason that caused the shift of the website's contents deals with the
    interests of prospective exchange participants. During this semester AIESEC
    Laurier conducted 28 consultations with individuals who were gung-ho about
    going on exchange. 26/28 of these individuals were mainly looking for
    opportunities in Taiwan, and 2 of the other individuals decided they no
    longer wanted to go on exchange. This huge focus towards taiwan was another
    reason why we decided to go ahead with using the 2 testimonials we had for
    Taiwan.
