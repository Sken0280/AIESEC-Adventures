          <p>My Time in Taiwan was filled with nothing but fun times. Teaching
            English at Xipu Elementary school in Tainan, Taiwan was such an
            amazing experience. I got to try so many new things and meet so many
            awesome people. It also opened up my eyes to a career that I never
            really considered. I learned so much about the culture, the
            language, and as well, I was able to grow heaps and bounds both
            professionally and personally.</p>
          <img src="images/water.jpg">
          <p>Not only did I get to try a lot of things I wouldn't have even
            thought I would ever try, but I was also able to meet other
            individuals from all over the world who were also doing an exchange
            project in Taiwan. During the weekends, we would travel all around
            Taiwan exploring and sightseeing. The highlight of my trip was when
            we took a ferry to a nearby Taiwanese island named 小琉球 (XiaoLiuQui).
            During this 3 day trip, we went scuba diving, hiking through
            mountainous areas, and really bonded as friends. Even though we had
            only known each other for such a short period of time, it felt like
            we had known each other for many years.</p>
          <img src="images/host%20family.jpg">
          <p>During my time in Taiwan, I also stayed with a host family. From
            the first day I arrived, everyone was so kind and caring and it felt
            like they were actually my family. They even bought me a birthday
            cake to celebrate me turning 19 while I was there. The first couple
            of weeks of my exchange, they took me out on weekends to go
            sightseeing and to Tainan city's famous night markets where one
            could purchase many different types of tradition Taiwanese foods
            such as Taiwanese chicken steaks, stinky tofu, and their delicious
            beef noodle bowls. In addition, there was also many places you could
            shop at, meaning there was something for everyone. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p style="height: 12px;">If you're thinking about going on an
              exchange, just do it because you never know what kind of
              friendships you will make and what kind of things you will learn</p>

          <p>It wasn’t that hard for me to adjust to Taiwan. However, I did need
            some time to adapt to the new environment. It ranged from big things
            such as seeing all the signs in Chinese, needing to speak Mandarin,
            and trying to find my way around the city to small things such as
            drinking a lot more tea whenever I went out with friends</p>
          <p>I found it useful to ground myself to something. For instance, The
            teachers at Jee An Elementary School are welcoming and friendly.
            They always made sure that I am well taken care of and helped me a
            lot along the way. Therefore, it was easy to make friends and feel
            comfortable around them. As well, I love children. I found them very
            cute, especially the preschoolers. Whenever they see me, they would
            yell out my name to greet me, despite the fact that I am half way
            across the school. They are extremely sweet so they brighten my day.</p>
          <img src="images/katherine.jpg">
          <p>Also, I maintained contact with my family and friends in Vancouver,
            basically the people who I can talk just about everything with. It
            helped that the local LC, AIESEC CKLC (National Cheng Kung
            University) took great care in helping me to adjust to Taiwan. They
            had arranged a welcoming party for me and a new Exchange Participant
            from Brazil, Fabi. They also arranged different events throughout
            the three months period so that we were able to keep in touch, such
            as going to see a movie. For anyone thinking of going on exchange, I
            my advice would just to be open-minded. There are always things that
            didn’t turn out the way I wanted. However, I wasn’t here to get
            pampered, I was there to experience something different. Therefore,
            I didn’t let the disappointments get in my way too much.</p>
          <img src="images/party.jpg">
          <p>On exchange, I was able do things I have never done before. For
            instance, because Madou, the place where I was staying at, is in a
            small town, I was able to go to the field and pick oranges. As well,
            I was able to create a picture using real flowers and leaves—the
            Flower Art.</p>
          <p>During my free time, I did a bit of travelling with friends and
            experienced the Taiwanese culture. The highlight of my trip is
            visiting Tainan. It is one of the oldest cities in Taiwan. Little is
            known before the Dutch came to Taiwan during the 1600. However, the
            Dutch occupied it for only about twenty years before the Chinese
            came and banished them off. After, during the end of the 1800, the
            Japanese took over Taiwan and had stayed for almost fifty years. As
            a result, Taiwan’s architectures are influenced those by the Dutch,
            Chinese, and the Japanese. Particularly in Tainan, there were a lot
            of historical monuments around the city. I was able to go around
            Tainan and got to learn about the history and geographic of the
            place and henceforth, Taiwan.</p>
          <p>For those who are still deciding, I really recommend going on a
            exchange. You get to meet different people, do things you never
            thought you will ever do, and pick up a new language along the way.
